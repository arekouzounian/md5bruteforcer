# md5bruteforcer
for ITP125 final project

This is a simple script that is designed to crack MD5 passwords. 
It's only supposed to crack the hashes in [hashes.txt](hashes.txt), which correspond to the answers in [answers.txt](answers.txt).
Further improvement may include using GPU power, and multi-threading capabilities.
